# V1 Engineering Documentation

This is the future home of the V1Engineering documentation (maybe).

Please wait to move actual v1engineering.com documentation over. It would be a real pain to do a lot
of that work and then find that this solution is not the right one in some way.

[This documentation is hosted on
github.io](https://v1engineeringinc.github.io/V1EngineeringInc-Docs)

[The source code is on github](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/V1EngineeringInc-Docs)

!!! note
    Most of these pages are just filler to play with navigation. The actual documentation is still at
    [v1engineering.com](https://www.v1engineering.com/assembly/)

## Editing

On any page, you can click on the little pencil in the top right.

That will take you to github to the source for the page you want to edit.

??? "But wait, I don't want to edit source code, I'm not a programmer"

    *Great!* Programmers aren't always the best writers. We're using *MarkDown* which is more like word
    than a programming language. For the most part, the text is just text, and things like titles and
    pictures just need a few goofy characters to turn into titles and pictures.

In github, there is a little bar at the top of the file with another pencil. If you click on that,
you will be guided to make the change and submit the changes back to the project. This is a
"Pull Request". After that, your changes will be approved and merged into the documentation, and
others can avoid the same problems you had.

Before you go, make sure you add yourself to the [about page](about.md) so that everyone knows how
awesome you are for making a contribution.

I've put some more markdown info [here](mkdocs_info.md)

??? "I want to develop more, faster, better, stronger"

    You can do some powerful things if you want to mkdocs on your computer while editing the
    documents. There are some basic instructions in the [mkdocs info
    page](mkdocs_info.md#local-mkdocs)

## Next Steps

We have a skeleton that matches the bones of v1engineering.com's documentation. We need to convert
the files over to flesh it out, and then we can move on to editing the documentation.
