# About

These instructions are a collection of knowledge from the V1 Engineering community. They are
designed for collaboration in mind and edits are welcome. Please help us make this documentation
better.

This idea started in the forums: [Community Documentation](https://www.v1engineering.com/forum/topic/community-documentation/)

The forums are a great way to get help. Please stop by and ask questions or share what you're
building.
